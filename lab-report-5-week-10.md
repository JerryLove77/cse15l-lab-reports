# **Jianrui Zhang's Lab Report 5**

## Different Test:

For demonstration purposes, I would use `342.md` as two examples of different output from `my-markdown-parser` and the recent implement of `markdown-parser`.

I was able to find the tests with different results using `vimdiff` on the result.

Here is the links to the test files:
